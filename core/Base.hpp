/**
 * @brief
 * initializes Opengl and configures and displays the application window
 * - Startup: During this stage, objects are created, values are initialized, and any required external files are loaded.
 * - Main Loop: This stage repeats continuously (typically 60 times per second) while the application is running, and
 *   consists of the following three substages:
 *      -# Process Input: Check if the user has performed any action that sends data to the computer,
 *        such as pressing keys on a keyboard or clicking buttons on a mouse.
 *      -# Update: Changing values of variables and objects.
 *      -# Render: Create graphics that are displayed on the screen.
 *
 * - Shutdown: This stage typically begins when the user performs an action indicating
 * that the program should stop running (for example, by clicking a button to quit the
 * application). This stage may involve tasks such as signaling the application to stop
 * checking for user input and closing any windows that were created by the application.
